> UF Open Source Club‚Äôs 24-hour mini-hack submission.

Scheduling classes can be a hassle, especially when having to navigate between different pages such as the degree audit, course scheduler, major course list, and elective course list. The **Course Scheduler** project integrates all these functionalities into one efficient chatbot. This service exemplifies what UF could offer to enhance the student experience, supporting UF's vision of becoming an AI-driven university. üöÄ

Using high-tech tools like RAG ü§ñ and Gen AI üß†, we've created a robust demo within 10 hours that showcases what's possible, even without the extensive resources of a leading AI university. Enjoy and contribute! ‚ù§Ô∏è
