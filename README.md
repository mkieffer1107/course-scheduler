# Course Scheduler

> UF Open Source Club‚Äôs 24-hour mini-hack submission.

When scheduling classes, it is extremely annoying to transition between the degree audit page, the course scheduler, the minor courses list, the major courses list,
the elective course list, etc. The **Course Scheduler** aims to integrate all of these features into a single chatbot as an example for a service that UF could offer to all students. 
This would help aid in UF's goal of buliding an AI university! üöÄ

Using high-tech tools like RAG ü§ñ and Gen AI üß†, we've created a robust demo within 10 hours that showcases what's possible, even without the extensive resources of a leading AI university. Enjoy and contribute! ‚ù§Ô∏è
