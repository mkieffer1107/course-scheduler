# course-scheduler
UF Open Source Clubâ€™s 24-hour mini-hack submission


When scheduling classes, it is extremely annoying to transition between
the degree audit page, the course scheduler, and the major course list,
elective course list, etc. This project aims to integrate all of these
features into a single chatbot as an example for a service that UF could
offer to all students. This would help aid in UF's goal of buliding an
AI university!

Keep in mind that this is a demo built in roughly 10 hours by students
without the vast resources and up-to-date schedules of America's first
AI university! Enjoy <3
